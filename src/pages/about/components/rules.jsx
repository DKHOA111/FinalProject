          <b>Upload Rules</b>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Only titles that are in the comic styles of Japanese, Korean,
            Chinese, Vietnamese origin are allowed. Exceptions can be made for
            self-published comics in a similar style originally created in other
            languages if you contact staff beforehand.
          </li>
          <li>
            Only scanlations (i.e. comics translated and edited into another
            language) and self-published original comics are allowed to be
            uploaded. Works with no text to translate, like artwork
            compilations, are not allowed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The only exemptions to this rule are when:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Permission has been granted by the publisher and/or creator.
              </li>
              <li>The uploader belongs to 1 group.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Any scanlated release is allowed to be uploaded regardless of the
            existence of official translations, except under the following
            restrictions:
            <ul>
              <li>
                If a release has one group and this group has enabled upload
                restrictions, only their group members may upload it. Users who
                deliberately circumvent group upload restrictions will have
                their chapter uploading privileges restricted.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a released manga has multiple groups and at least one of the
                groups is unlocked, the chapter can be uploaded without adding
                the locked groups. A member of one of the locked groups can
                contact 3KManga staff and ask for their group to be added to the
                release.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Both using the translated script and raw images of an official
            release as the basis of a scanlation are allowed only if the
            scanlated release has been re-translated into a different language.
          </li>
          <li>
            Both using the translated script and images of a scanlation as the
            basis of a new scanlation are generally allowed as long as there is
            a significant difference from the source release, such as being
            translated to another language, having significantly improved
            typesetting, or higher quality raws.
          </li>
          <li>Joke or troll releases are not allowed.</li>
          <li>
            Publishing a scanlated chapter before the official raw chapter is
            released in the original country is prohibited.
          </li>
          <li>
            Uploading a chapter created by a tool that automatically edits and
            generates translated pages is not allowed. This includes tools that
            allow for additional manual editing after the automated process.
          </li>
          <li>
            Permanently withholding some of your scanlations to a series for the
            purpose of attracting users to your site is not allowed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not add duplicate requests. Search for multiple alternate titles
            to confirm it doesn't exist yet before requesting for a new manga.
            Check your language and content filters to make sure you're not
            inadvertently hiding the work. If there happen to be multiple
            distinct requests with the same title, do not add anything to
            distinguish them, such as "(Author name)". Use the actual title as
            it is.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you want to upload a oneshot chapter, the chapter should be set
            to 0 and the category should be “Oneshot”.
          </li>
          <li>
            The publication status refers to the status of publication in the
            country of origin, not the scanlation status of the title.
          </li>
          <li>
            Genres should be added only if the tag is a representation of the
            title as a whole, not just appearing in a single chapter.
          </li>
          <li>All file formats are approved.</li>
          <li>
            The language set for a title should reflect the official or
            officially localized name for that language region.
          </li>
          <li>
            Loan words are to be as they are in their original respective
            language. For example: "日本語の単語の例" to "Example Japanese
            words".
          </li>
          <li>
            Only add official titles, official abbreviations, romanizations, or
            full proper translations as titles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not arbitrarily combine several chapters into a single release.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are not part of the scanlation group, do not alter the
            release you are uploading by any means.
          </li>
          <li>
            Source uploads directly from the scanlator when possible. Avoid
            uploading compressed chapters from other aggregators unless there is
            no other option.
          </li>
          <li>
            When uploading a chapter, select all the groups that worked on it.
            If one of the groups does not exist on the site yet, create it
            first.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you do not yet know who scanlated the chapter, do not upload it.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the creator of the scanlation does not have a group, create a
            group named after their username and assign the chapter to this
            group.
          </li>
          <li>
            If all the groups associated with the release are locked, only the
            relevant group members may upload the chapter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Only add volume numbers to chapters that have been published
            together in a volume. If the chapter has not been published in a
            volume yet, do not guess what volume it should be in, just leave the
            volume field blank.
          </li>
          <li>
            For entries that use season numbering (such as some Korean
            webtoons), use the volume field for the season number.
          </li>
